# boilerplate

`npm install`

`mkdir test`

`npm link`

`cd test`

`slush boilerplate`





devDependencies.json is a list npm modules where you can put version number. If you add a devDependencies in one of your slush tasks don't forget to add it to the devDependencies.json file.

TODO:  postinstall should call 'gulp install' also.

"npm install && gulp install" seems to always repeat.
